# Attacker Configuration

This document is designed to outline the specifications and methods through which attacking teams will attempt to gain access.

## Attacks that are *not* permitted

There are a series of attack methodologies that are not permitted. They might not be allowed because the risk of damage to an outside machine is too high, if it would be likely to trip common security measures on a network, or for some other discretionary reason.

- Network attacks are not permitted. The risk of damage to outside machines is too high, and common network attacks would likely cause several machines to be blacklisted.
- Ransomware attacks are not permitted. The risk of damage to outside machines is too high.

## Attacks that are permitted

- Social engineering attacks are permitted and encouraged.
  + Social engineering attacks must be carried out on the specified target, not on any external provider (such as a cell phone provider).
  + A social engineering attack is defined as an attempt to convince the victim to voluntarily forfeit information by tricking them into believing the origin of the attack is legitimate.
  + Social engineering attacks include phishing attempts, fake websites, or other authentication-based attacks.
- Brute-force authentication attacks are permitted.
  + A brute-force authentication attack must only be carried out on the specified target, not on any external provider.
  + A brute-force authentication attack is defined as an attempt to guess a username/password combination by randomly guessing passwords or guessing from a predefined list.
