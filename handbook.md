# What is the Kenyon Hackathon?

The Kenyon Hackathon is an opportunity for teams of students (not necessarily computer-science students) to test their skills at social engineering (people hacking) and computer hacking in a controlled and safe environment. It will provide a real-world problem that already afflicts many companies and organizations, and it will showcase the different solutions that brilliant students can come up with to both exploit and patch humans and computers.

The Kenyon Hackathon is unlike any other hackathon in the world. Most hackathons are designed for open problem-solving, and merely present an opportunity to kickstart a project or finish a project that's been sluggishly progressing. Conversely, the Kenyon Hackathon is a competition where all participants are working towards the same challenge: to try and compromise someone through social engineering, computer hacking, phishing, and by other means. It follows a much more abbreviated schedule than other hackathons (4 hours instead of 24 hours), with a much tighter set of rules for the competition, akin to a programming contest.

During the competition, each team will be provided with a volunteer victim, who will be coached through how to reveal their own vulnerabilities. During the problem-solving period, teams will attempt to extract information from that volunteer victim. In the end, the team that's able to extract the most valuable information wins!

## The Spirit of the Hackathon

Hackathons are fun, and lots of different people participate for lots of different reasons. Although the hackathon is structured like a competition, most students are participating to learn and have a good time, not to win. Our hackathon's spirit is to learn, build, and share. No one knows everything, but this is a great place to learn lots!

### Learn

The hacker spirit is about learning and teaching. During the competition, you'll learn plenty from your own teammates, who will have different strengths than you, and afterwards, talk with other teams to find out how they approached the problem! Our hackathon is designed to be great for beginners. You don't even have to ever taken a computer science course to participate!

The hackathon is a great opportunity to learn new things and meet new friends. It's okay to ask for help! Everybody at the hackathon will be happy to help! Getting hints and help on your hack won't make you lose points; that's what the hackathon is meant to do!

Maybe you know something that your teammates don't! Offer help and constructive feedback when you can. For example, do not feign surprise ("OMG how can you not know what a keylogger does?!"), but rather, introduce people to things that they may not know!

### Build

You're encouraged to show up with nothing built. In fact, that's the whole point! Using an already-working software package kind of defeats the purpose of the hackathon. Instead, use the opportunity to build a new solution, write some new software, and learn how you can do something more efficiently! If you weren't able to finish the software, that's fine! Others will be happy to see what you did manage to build and what you learned! What matters is that you attempted to build something!

### Share

You should communicate a lot during the hackathon contest! You and your teammates need to work together to succeed! But you should also be friendly to the other teams! They'll probably offer solutions and ideas that you never thought of! You'll get a lot more from the hackathon by trying to work with other teams and ask questions than by trying to work against them. Teams are encouraged to offer help and advice to each other! You can text or message other teams during the competition.

## What if…?

### What if I don’t know how to code?

No problem! You still have strengths that your teammates don't have, and you'll be a huge asset to them! What if you're an art major? You can work on ways to engineer a phishing scam on your volunteer victim! What if you're a psychology major? You can try to run a social engineering hack over the phone and get your volunteer victim's email address! That doesn't take any code! You're surrounded by experienced coders, willing to help you out and guide you, and you'll be able to offer your own insight.

### What if I don’t know anyone there?

Not to worry! You'll meet new people when you get there! Everyone's friendly, and some people go to hackathons without a team! You'll build a team once you get to the hackathon, and it's a great way to make new friends and learn something new!

### What if I don’t know what I’m doing?

You have an entire room of really smart people, and they can help you! Don't be afraid to ask for help! If your entire team's stuck, it's also okay to go to another room and ask for help or hints! The hackathon is supposed to be a highly collaborative event!

## Venue & Dates

Due to the current CoVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic, the 2021 Kenyon Hackathon will be held entirely virtually, through Cisco WebEx or Zoom.

The date is to be announced, but the contest will likely be held on a Saturday morning in late March.

### Without the pandemic...

We're currently living in strange and bizarre times, but without the pandemic, what would the hackathon look like? What would we try to emulate with Cisco WebEx or Zoom?

It's a cool March morning, and in the morning, students trickle into an academic building from all of the different schools. At 9a, students are briefed on their task, and they split to come up with teams and team names. Then, they can split into their own rooms, each with a chalkboard and a power strip.

Over the next three hours, they toy with a volunteer victim, trying to extract as much information as they can. They try all sorts of different techniques, like impersonation (phishing), hacking (directly stealing information), or compromising a system (convincing the system to give up information, with a virus, spyware, or keylogger).

Afterwards, they submit their results to the judges, who evaluate each team's success and award points, and a winner (or winners) is announced!

## Registration and Recruitment

Everyone is welcome to register for the Kenyon Hackathon, and we'd encourage small teams to recruit others to join their team! You are especially encouraged to get students that are not computer-science students to join your team!

See the Teams page for specifications on the size and composition of teams. You should form teams before the contest begins, but be willing to take in an extra team member that arrives late! Once you have formed a team, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/ffkQaCHjcG6Lb8zm6) to register your team!

We also need volunteers! If your team is awkwardly shaped or you just have too many people (but not enough to make a new team), then we'd encourage you to volunteer! We need computer scientists to judge, and contest organizers and facilitators! Volunteers will be coordinated about a week before the contest.

## What should I bring?

### Software

- Text editor: ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)) - you'll need to view data and probably write some code, unless you're not a developer
- Version control: Git ([Setup a GitHub account](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) ahead of time!)
- [A hype Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/album/2M1GALCY5qHllHs0wvA1T6?si=FqxBi9-9TGe9byXanvWQcQ)
- That’s pretty much it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Items

- Wallet + ID (including student ID)
- Computer and phone
- Headset or headphones + microphone
- Charger for phone
- Water bottle
- Coffee (if you're a coffee drinker)
- Tea (if you're a tea drinker)
- Snacks

### What Is Provided

- Instructions
- A room to work from

## Team Specifications

Teams must conform to a specification, given here:

- Teams must be greater than 4 people but smaller than 6 people
- Teams must all come from the same school
- Teams need not have only computer science - we strongly encourage you to bring a non-computer-scientist to your team; they'll help a lot with creative problem solving!
- A 15% point bonus will be given to teams that have no computer science, mathematics, or statistics majors on their team
- A 5% point bonus will be given to teams that have at least one non-CS, math, or stat major on their team

Your participants should adhere to the following rules:

- Competitors must have less than two years of serious coding experience, excluding education
- Competitors must have never placed top three in a hackathon before
- Competitors must be enrolled as a full-time student at the school that they are representing

We encourage you to build a team before arriving to the event, but if you don't have team (and still want to participate), there will be an opportunity for each team to build a team at the event.

Each team must also have a unique name. Come up with something fun, but avoid including your school's name! Here are some examples:

- Al Gore's Rhythms
- Boolean Autocrats
- `.titanic {float: none;}`
- Game of Threads
- [DROP TABLE `teams`;--](https://xkcd.com/327/)
- Hackstreet Boys

## Judging

Teams will be judged on three criteria. The completion score is worth half of the overall score, while integration and learning scores are worth a quarter of the overall score.

- Integration: How technologically impressive were the techniques used? How were other academic disciplines integrated into the hack? Were particularly clever techniques used?
- Learning: Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new?
- Completion: How many of the objectives were completed? Were the teams able to steal most of the information, or only some of it?

Completion scores for each team will be determined by the amount of data that was stolen and the value of each chunk of stolen data, along with any bonus data that was not indicated on the scoring sheet. It is very possible that no teams solve certain problems, so in the end, all completion scores will be normalized. The highest-performing team will get 50 points and all other scores will be normalized according to that team’s score.

Each team will be judged by a panel of three judges, who are blind to the school, but not necessarily the team name (unless the team name contains the school name).

These criteria will guide the judges, but ultimately, the judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which teams are the most impressive and most deserving (not the most technologically advanced! It'll pay to have non-CS students on your team!)

It's important to note that the judging criteria do not include:

- How good your code is: It doesn't matter if your code is messy, poorly commented, or inefficient; the judges understand that you're trying to deploy prototype software to your volunteer victim
- How senior your teammates are: Older or higher-level teammates do not equate to more points; the quality of your hacking does

## Rules and Regulations

You will also be provided with the rules during the competition. Some infractions of the rules are more severe than others, but don't break any of the rules.

- You may spoof your phone number.
- You may mimic old or previously used attacks.
- You may use computers and the Internet to find solutions, fabricate scenarios, and execute attacks.
- You may deploy social engineering attacks on the victim and their service providers (for phone, email, and online accounts)
- You may deploy keyloggers or spyware that you have coded or developed by yourselves.
  + You can have prepared up to 80% of the software before the competition. Everything else must be coded during the competition.
  + You may not use software significantly created by others; this must be less than approximately 20% of the codebase.
  + Do NOT sign code or get code signatures from a certificate authority during the contest.
  + You can use preexisting code libraries or documentation that are available through standard package managers; for example, if you were coding in Python, it is acceptable to use the Pandas library or copy code from the Internet that is licensed under a redistributable license, like the Apache 2.0 or MIT license, as long as you credit your sources
  + Keyloggers are defined as software that capture keystrokes or mouse clicks and transmit them back to an attacker's computer; they are not limited to just the logging software
  + Spyware is defined as software that captures information displayed or invisible to the user, including event logs, system settings, system configurations (such as processor information, RAM, microcode versions, graphics chipsets, or networking hardware), desktop screenshots, webcam pictures or video, clipboard contents, sniffed network packets, or other data of similar nature, and transmit them back to the attacker's computer
- You may NOT attack other teams in an attempt to slow or stop their progress; you will not have the same volunteer victim as another team
- You may NOT deploy any attacks on any government agency, including any branch of the U.S. government.
- You may NOT deploy any malware to anyone or exploit any systems except the victim or the victim's computer. By extension, you may not attack any computer network or service provider with malware.
- You may NOT deploy ransomware or software that is designed to lock and encrypt files.
- You may NOT deploy a botnet or software that is designed to attack many computers outside of the victim. However, you may pool your team's computing resources together (like a farm of laptops that you collectively own) to break an encryption key by brute force.
- You may NOT coerce or threaten your victim to extract information.
- Any malicious software or code that is generated during the contest MUST be destroyed after completion unless it reveals critical security vulnerabilities in a pre-existing piece of software
  + If it does, report it to the contest organizers after contest completion. We will work with you to report it to the original developers. If there is a bug bounty involved, you will earn all of the proceeds.
  + You may NOT redistribute malicious software or code.
- All team members should be present at the event.
- Teams can, of course, gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, and others.
- Teams must stop hacking once the time is up.
- Projects that violate the Code of Conduct are not allowed.
- Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to, breaking the Competition rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsportsmanlike behavior.
